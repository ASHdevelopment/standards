## <a name="variables">Variables</a>

### 1.1 `const/let/var`
#### When working in ES6 (Ember Projects, gulpfile, etc.)

Default to `const`. If you need to change the value later on, then you can use `let`. Do not use `var` **ever**

> This ensures that you can't reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

#### When in legacy code (non-Ember projects)
Do **not** use `const` or `let`.

### 1.2 Instantiate variables at top of functions

> Avoids issues with hoisting and temporal dead zones

```javascript
//bad
function foo() {
	this.year = 1993;

	const foo = 'bar';

	this.baz = foo;
}

//good
function foo() {
	const foo = 'bar';

	this.year = 1993;
	this.baz = foo;
}
```

### 1.3 Declare variables across several lines

> Simplify changeset diffs, reduce risk of creating global variables, helps with breakpoints.

```javascript
//very bad
function foo() {
	const foo = 1, bar = 2, baz = 3;
}

//bad
function foo() {
	const foo = 1,
		  bar = 2,
		  baz = 3;
}

//good
function foo() {
	const foo = 'bar';
	const bar = 2;
	const baz = 3;
}
```

### 1.4 Group together `const` and `let` declarations
> To avoid complications...

```javascript
//bad
function sheNever() {
	const foo = 1;
	let bar = 2;
	const baz = 3;
	let bae = 4;
}

//good
function keptTheSameAddress() {
	const foo = 1;
	const baz = 3;
	let bar = 2;
	let bae = 4;
}
```

### 1.5 Variable Casing
When using `const`, do *not* capitalize the variable name.

> It's unnecessary.


```javascript
//bad
const FOO = 1;
const BAR = 3;

//good
const foo = 1;
const baz = 3;
```

## <a name="strings">Strings</a>

### 2.1 String Literals (ES6 only)
> This ensures readability in strings where variables are inserted

Always use string literals when concatenating strings together.

```javascript
//bad
const string = 'The ASH UI team is ' + awesomeAdjective + '!';

//good
const string = `The ASH UI team is ${awesomeAdjective}!`;
```

## <a name="arrays">Arrays</a>

### 3.1 Dangling Commas
There is no hard standard for dangling commas.

> Yes it looks ugly and weird but it has benefits in simplifying diffs.

```javascript
//ok
const arr = [
	'foo',
	'bar',
];
const obj = {
	hey: true,
	jude: true,
};

//also ok
const arr = [
	'foo',
	'bar'
];
const obj = {
	hey: true,
	jude: true
};
```

## <a name="objects">Objects</a>

### 4.1 Method Declarations
**When able to code in ES6**, use shorthand method declarations. Otherwise normal method declarations are OK.

```javascript
//bad unless stuck in ES5
const obj = {
    doThisThing: function() {
        return true;
    }
};

//good (but only in ES6)
const obj = {
    doThisThing() {
        return true;
    }
};
```

### 4.2 Dangling Commas
There is no hard standard for dangling commas.

> Yes it looks ugly and weird but it has benefits in simplifying diffs.

```javascript
//ok
const arr = [
	'foo',
	'bar',
];
const obj = {
	hey: true,
	jude: true,
};

//also ok
const arr = [
	'foo',
	'bar'
];
const obj = {
	hey: true,
	jude: true
};
```

## <a name="functions">Functions</a>

### 5.1 Arrow Functions
#### You can only use these within ES6. Ignore this section when working with ES5.

Arrow functions cut down and have special properties in terms of lexical scoping.

This preserve the value of `this` which removes the need for you to "save" the value of this (commonly as `that` or `self`).

```javascript
const myObject = {
	init() {
		const that = this;

		someFunctionWithCallback(1, function() {
			console.log(this);

			//logs the Window object. Most likely not the behavior you are expecting. You have use the "that" variable we initiated up there.

			console.log(that);
		});
	},
	init2() {
		someFunctionWithCallback(1, () => {
			console.log(this);

			//logs myObject!
		});
	}
}
```
When there is only one parameter, do not encased it in parenthesis.

```javascript

//bad
let itemsLength = items.map((item)=>{
 return item.length;
});

//good
let itemsLength = items.map( item =>{
 return item.length;
});
```

#### Exceptions
Use normal syntax for things like event listeners where do **not** want to preserve `this`.

```javascript
// This is a special exception.
//bad
thing.on('click', e => {
	$(this).addClass('newClass');
	//this will NOT work
});

//good
thing.on('click', function(e) {
	$(this).addClass('newClass');
});
```

## <a name="iteration">Iteration</a>

### 6.1 Use of `for` loop vs. iterative methods (`.map()`, `.forEach()`, etc.)

**When working with large datasets**, use the classic `for` loop as it allows you to `break;` out of the iteration, which prevents the expense of looping through unnecessary items after a certain criteria has been met. **You cannot do this with iterative methods**

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, ... 10,000];
const newArray = [];

// Bad
array.forEach((item, index) => {
	if (index < 50) {
		newArray.push(item * 3);
	}
});

// Good
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
	if (i === 50) {
		break;
	}
	newArray.push(array[i] * 3);
}
```

## <a name="json">JSON</a>

## <a name="#trycatch">Try/Catch</a>

### 7.1 Usage
> Helps catch errors before they cause the code to blow up

**Use try/catch block if:**
 - You are attempting to access an object that is more than **two levels** deep
 - You are even slightly uncertain that the object structure may vary

**Tips**
- Make sure that the catch block of the try/catch does something meaningful for the user
- If you need a fail-safe error message to display as a result of the catch in a try/catch, talk to your PO for the message content

```javascript
//bad
function showErrorMessage (arg1){
	//this will result in Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'responseJSON' of undefined
	error = arg1.response.responseJSON.responseStatus;
	return error;
}

```

**Executing something after try catch:** Use finally to execute that code rather than rewrite the code twice or only write for the happier (try) path.

```javascript
//good
function showErrorMessage (arg1){
	try {
		error = arg1.response.responseJSON.responseStatus;
	} catch (e) {
		error = 'Something went wrong fetching the response'; //in this case, e is undefined so you don't need it on the line above
		//OR
		error = e;
	} finally {
		removeLoader();
		return error;
	}		
}

```
## <a name="#libraries">Libraries</a>

### 8.1 jQuery

#### Use in all QUnit tests
> Why? It is quicker to write unit tests in jQuery, unit tests are not production code, and besides, QUnit was developed by the jQuery team. So why not?

#### Use $.ajax() rather than XMLHttpRequest() for server requests
> Why? The jquery AJAX wrapper is much simpler to write and the speed hit is minute compared to an entire project written in jQuery

**Note:** AJAX Calls in non-Ember projects should utilize `$$ash.ajax`.

#### Write in Vanilla JavaScript wherever possible
> Why? jQuery is a huge library, and no longer necessary for cross-browser compatibility. Writing in vanilla javascript will also give you a deeper understanding of the core language

**Note:** When updating legacy code to use vanilla javascript, be mindful of which objects are passed to 3rd party plugins or in-house plugins that still use jQuery, and wrap the object in a jQuery wrapper accordingly
